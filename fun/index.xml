I used to play this game in school days and had lots of fun.
This is the 2nd part of the Prince of Persia Trilogy .
All 3 games in the trilogy are good, but this 2nd part was the best of them.
What I loved At that time I didn&amp;rsquo;t understood the game story, I just used to love the parkour type of moves which we can do in this game and finding the way through this adventure game.</description></item><item><title>Attack on Titan</title><link>https://www.rohilaharsh.in/fun/aot/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Aug 2023 23:00:09 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://www.rohilaharsh.in/fun/aot/</guid><description>Attack on Titan is a show whose story is one of the best I ever came across.
