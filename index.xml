You&amp;rsquo;re not alone. In TypeScript, developers often use Promises and forget to handle errors, leading to runtime crashes that could have been prevented at compile time.
Languages like Java have a built-in solution: checked exceptions. They force developers to handle potential errors before the code even compiles. But TypeScript?</description></item><item><title>Clean Architecture in Frontend</title><link>https://www.rohilaharsh.in/posts/clean-arch/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Mar 2025 09:30:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://www.rohilaharsh.in/posts/clean-arch/</guid><description>Clean Architecture in Frontend Recently, the term &amp;ldquo;Clean Architecture&amp;rdquo; was discussed in my company. It sounded interesting, so I started thinking about whether we could use it in frontend projects too. To understand it better, I read &amp;ldquo;Clean Architecture&amp;rdquo; by Robert C. Martin.
After learning the basics, I tried applying Clean Architecture to a frontend project. In this blog, I will share my experience and how I built a To-Do CRUD app, which you can check out here .</description></item><item><title>Implementing YouTube's feature - Play video on thumbnail hover</title><link>https://www.rohilaharsh.in/posts/video-play-on-hover/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Mar 2024 09:29:13 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://www.rohilaharsh.in/posts/video-play-on-hover/</guid><description>Today I implemented a feature of YouTube in my app . This feature will play video on hover of the thumbnail of a video.
Code Changes This commit is having the changes I did for implementing this feature.
Implementation Explaination I have used template like below for showing thumbnail card for videos &amp;lt;div class=&amp;#34;card&amp;#34;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;img class=&amp;#34;thumbnail&amp;#34; src={this.thumbnail}&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/img&amp;gt; &amp;lt;div class=&amp;#34;video-preview&amp;#34;&amp;gt; {this.stream &amp;amp;&amp;amp; this.showVideoPreview &amp;amp;&amp;amp; ( &amp;lt;video-player sources={this.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes, using TypeScript</title><link>https://www.rohilaharsh.in/posts/kubernetes/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Mar 2024 09:29:13 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://www.rohilaharsh.in/posts/kubernetes/</guid><description>At my work, I learned Kubernetes and used that to migrate an old API project. It required lots of learning and research. In this post, I will share my learnings, so it can help others getting started with Kubernetes.
Kubernetes Cluster To use Kubernetes, we need a Kubernetes Cluster. I used AWS EKS for that. EKS can be used with AWS Fargate and EC2 instances. I went with Fargate. To create most things in AWS, AWS CDK can be used.</description></item><item><title>Callback Pattern</title><link>https://www.rohilaharsh.in/posts/callback-pattern/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Mar 2024 09:29:13 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://www.rohilaharsh.in/posts/callback-pattern/</guid><description>A different view of Functions People experienced in JS have a different view of functions compared to people new to JS coming from background of C, C++, Java.
Consider below JS function
let sum = function (a, b) { return a + b } The idea of storing a function in variable might seem weird to new JS developers, but this is a powerful feature of JS. This can be used in interesting ways.</description></item><item><title>RxJS Zip Operator Use Case</title><link>https://www.rohilaharsh.in/posts/rxjs-zip-operator/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Mar 2024 09:29:13 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://www.rohilaharsh.in/posts/rxjs-zip-operator/</guid><description>I like writing RxJS code. It makes it easy to combine async logic with sync and it treats both of these things in same way.
Recently, at my work, I used zip operator for the first time. I used this in a NestJS project. This operator is not commonly used. In this post I will share for which problem I used it and how it was used.
The Problem I have an array of input objects.</description></item><item><title>Prince of Persia Warrior Within</title><link>https://www.rohilaharsh.in/fun/pop2/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Aug 2023 23:00:10 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://www.rohilaharsh.in/fun/pop2/</guid><description>About This is a PC game released in 2004. I used to play this game in school days and had lots of fun.
This is the 2nd part of the Prince of Persia Trilogy .
All 3 games in the trilogy are good, but this 2nd part was the best of them.
What I loved At that time I didn&amp;rsquo;t understood the game story, I just used to love the parkour type of moves which we can do in this game and finding the way through this adventure game.</description></item><item><title>Attack on Titan</title><link>https://www.rohilaharsh.in/fun/aot/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Aug 2023 23:00:09 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://www.rohilaharsh.in/fun/aot/</guid><description>Attack on Titan is a show whose story is one of the best I ever came across.

In this post, I will cover less common scenarios of writing scripts and IAAC in TypeScript.
Why use TypeScript for writing Scripts? This is for people who are familiar with TS and don&amp;rsquo;t know bash, to write scripts.
If you are using TS for your daily work, it would be easier to use the same language for scripts for automation as there is no context switching to another language.</description></item><item><title>Using RxJS with Stencil.js</title><link>https://www.rohilaharsh.in/posts/rxjs/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Apr 2023 09:29:13 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://www.rohilaharsh.in/posts/rxjs/</guid><description>RxJS is mainly popular with Angular Developers. In this post, I am going to share how I used RxJS with Stencil.js to build reactive components.
Ideas in this post should be applicable to other Frontend techs too.

Its original repo is archived, so I forked and started maintaining separate npm package. For now, I only did one change to use the latest TypeScript features with Glimmer.js v1
What is Glimmer.js Glimmer.js is a lightweight frontend tool like Preact to build components.
Why we are using it?

This post aims to be an easy explanation for Prototype feature
Why Prototype? For using inheritance
What is it? It&amp;rsquo;s a hidden property (denoted by [[Prototype]]) in every object. When a property (not present in an object) is accessed, JS tries to find it in that object&amp;rsquo;s Prototype.</description></item><item><title>A not so popular class pattern - TypeScript</title><link>https://www.rohilaharsh.in/posts/not-so-popular-oop-pattern/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Jun 2022 09:29:09 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://www.rohilaharsh.in/posts/not-so-popular-oop-pattern/</guid><description>TypeScript is a flexible language. Using it you can write code doing the same thing in multiple ways. This can be considered as both disadvantage and advantage of the language.
Disadvantage being, people need to know so many things to understand variety of codebases.
I consider this as a good thing, as it offers developers so many ways to express what code is doing. Developers can use that to make code more readable according to different situations.</description></item><item><title>Clean Code Book Summary</title><link>https://www.rohilaharsh.in/posts/clean-code-learnings/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 May 2022 08:41:09 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://www.rohilaharsh.in/posts/clean-code-learnings/</guid><description>The book Clean Code by Robert C Martin, changed the way I think about and write code.
Why Clean Code? Have a look at the image below which is from the book
I love this image. It clearly shows the frustration of developers reading bad code.
Clean code leads to code which other developers can understand quickly. Developers can easily change code without breaking any existing features.
A code which takes more time to make changes and is difficult to understand will decrease the team productivity</description></item><item><title>Top 10 Tools I found productive when working with TypeScript</title><link>https://www.rohilaharsh.in/posts/productive-js-tools/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 May 2022 08:01:01 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://www.rohilaharsh.in/posts/productive-js-tools/</guid><description>There are lots of software tools freely available to use.
