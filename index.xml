Using it you can write code doing the same thing in multiple ways. This can be considered as both disadvantage and advantage of the language.
Disadvantage being, people need to know so many things to understand variety of codebases.
I consider this as a good thing, as it offers developers so many ways to express what code is doing. Developers can use that to make code more readable according to different situations.</description></item><item><title>Clean Code Book Summary</title><link>https://www.rohilaharsh.in/posts/clean-code-learnings/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 May 2022 08:41:09 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://www.rohilaharsh.in/posts/clean-code-learnings/</guid><description>The book Clean Code by Robert C Martin, changed the way I think about and write code.
